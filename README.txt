OzWheat diversity panel is a collection of 286 Australian wheat cultivars that broadly reperesents lines that are commonly used in Australia as well as some experimental lines.
In 2016 the panel was grown in temperature controlled cabinets in Black Mountain in two batches, Long Day (L, 16 hours light) and Short Day (S, 8 hours light). Temperatures were maintained at 6C at 'night' and 10C at 'day'.
At the 2-leaf stage the apex of the plants were collected in a set 2-hour period and RNA was extracted. The RNA was sent for sequencing.
Sequencing conducted by Garvan Institute.
